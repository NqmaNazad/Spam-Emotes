### [How to setup Text-to-speech on Twitch as a Channel Points reward](https://spamemotes.com/posts/how-to-setup-tts/)

1. Download [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/api/releases/streamer.bot/latest/download)
> Link it to your Twitch
> - Open Streamer.bot
> - Click on â€˜Platformsâ€™
>    - Go to â€˜Twitchâ€™ tab and link your Twitch
>    - Should look like this:

3. After it is set up, go to â€˜Actionsâ€™ tab and right-click on **white space** in the Actions section.

> 4. Click on â€˜Addâ€™
> 5. On the â€˜Add Actionâ€™ window popup, you give the action a name (I named it â€˜Auto TTS Clip Captureâ€™, but you can name it whatever) 
> 6. Select the option to â€˜Always Runâ€™, since we are making it automatic. 
> 7. Click â€˜Ok.â€™ 
> 8. Now we have the Action ready and we move on to the â€˜Triggersâ€™ section and right-click the **white space.**
> 9. On the dropdown menu select **Twitch > Channel Reward > Reward Redemption**

10. Then you will get a popup to pick the Reward you want to set as a Trigger. (In my case, itâ€™s â€˜TTSâ€™ Reward) and then click â€˜**Okâ€™.**

11. Before moving on to the next step, you will need to copy the below code snippet: 
    
```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
    
public class CPHInline
{
public bool Execute()
{
Thread.Sleep(30000);
return true;
}
}
```  
> ðŸ’¡ If you have setup your TTS reward to run after a delay of 10 seconds for example,
>  you would want to add 10000ms into the method and change the
>  **Thread.Sleep(30000);** to **Thread.Sleep(40000);**
    
12. After copying the above code snippet, go to Sub-Actions section and right-click white space. 
> 13. **Select Core > C# > Execute C# Code**

> 14. You will get a window pop-up looking like this:

> 15. Just remove the code inside of this window and paste the code snippet copied earlier and click on **Compile**. (CTRL+A > CTRL+V) 
> 16. You should get a message in the Compiling Log saying that it has been compiled successfully like this:

> 17. If the above has been compiled successfully, you can go ahead and click on **â€˜Save and Compileâ€™.**
> 18. Right-click on **Sub-Actions white space** again and select **Twitch > Channel > Create Clip**. This will create your second Sub-Action.

1. (Optional) Go to your Discord Server and go to the channel you would like your clips to be posted to and Make a Webhook for the channel, set up the hook and copy itâ€™s link.
2. Right-click white space again and go to **Integrations > Discord > Basic Webhook.**
3. Give the hook names and put the url in place of the text in the **Webhook Url** box.
